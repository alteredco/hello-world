Hi! My name is Wendy.

A little about me:
I love coding! html, JS, CSS, php, python, node, mongodb, mysql, bring 'em at me! My second greatest passion is travel. I have lived in six different countries and speak a bit of Japanese, Chinese and Russian. Fun fact, I have been in the largest man-made cave in the world which just happens to be an abandoned nuclear plant!
